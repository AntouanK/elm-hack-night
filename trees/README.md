# Trees

## Building & Developing

``` sh
$ elm package install --yes
$ elm reactor

Then open http://localhost:8000/src/Main.elm.
```

## Challenges

See `src/Tree.elm`. The comments in that file will guide you through a

As you solve each, you can view your solution in the reactor.

If you get stuck, answers are in `src/TreeSolutions.elm`.
